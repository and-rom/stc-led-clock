#
# String table for ease of localization and general modification
#
# Comment lines begin with the hash (#) character
#
# Strings used for replacement of the entries in the "codeTemplate.txt" file
#
# Special characters used in text are underscore (_), decimal point (.) and comma (,)
#
# The underscore (_) will force the generation of a byte (0xff) that will display
# a blank character position. These fillers are required for table alignment.
#
# A decimal (.) is used to display the decimal on the LED. The decimal will
# be display with the character that preceeds the (.) in the source text below
#
# The comma (,) is used for the 1 inch LED display clocks that have the rotated
# LED in the third digit position. These clocks need the segments rotated
# 180 degrees to display properly. This should have been done in hardware
# but wasn't as it complicates the software. Lazy engineers.
# The comma associates with the character that preceeds it, like the decimal
#
# Strings can have only one decimal and one comma escape character per entry
#
# Two byte strings table
